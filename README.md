Hi, Iâ€™m wqqz â€” a secondary school student passionate about technology.  
I started by teaching myself web development, then explored artificial intelligence, and Iâ€™m now diving deep into cybersecurity â€” with a focus on hacking, anti-cheat systems, and penetration testing.  

I enjoy building, breaking, and learning from systems to better understand how technology works.  
Currently, Iâ€™m working on small projects, learning from open source, and documenting my journey into security research.
